# Chess

Implemented in Ruby

## Principles

* Keep public methods to an absolute minimum
* Try to decouple classes as much as possible

## TODO:

* implement player, maybe I'll jump that
* add 5D blindfolded variant for @timato
* save game state
* implement promotion (first situation that needs an input)
* Implement draw situations
  * threefold repetition, this actually needs the game class
  * 50 move rule, this needs the game class

## Testing

run `rake test`

## Blockage I had

## People to inform

* Chook?
