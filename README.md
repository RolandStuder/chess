Implemented in Ruby

## Principles

* Keep public methods to an absolute minimum
* Try to decouple classes as much as possible

## TODO:

* add 5D blindfolded variant for @timato
* save game state (not done, but would be easy thanks to fen serializer)
* write a bit about the journey and possibly interesting subject
* write about where I think there is room for improvements 

## Testing

run `rake test`

## Blockage I had

## People to inform
